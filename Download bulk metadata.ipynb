      "whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\n",

      "This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\n",

      "  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating\n",
      "through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\n",
      "through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\n",
      "through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\n",
      "strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\n",
      "making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\n",

      "      Swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of GRB 061121 (z=1.314),\n",
      "allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many\n",
      "other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes\n",
      "Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical\n",
      "emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and\n",
      "X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main\n",
      "peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt\n",
      "emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.\n",
      "The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from\n",
      "1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The\n",
      "optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather\n",
      "than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED\n",
      "shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour\n",
      "might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities\n",
      "similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The\n",
      "afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.\n",
      "Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are\n",
      "consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is\n",
      "the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a\n",
      "combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of\n",
      "2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is\n",
      "detected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the\n",

      "      It has been speculated that quantum gravity might induce a \"foamy\" space-time\n",
      "structure at small scales, randomly perturbing the propagation phases of\n",
      "free-streaming particles (such as kaons, neutrons, or neutrinos). Particle\n",
      "interferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\n",
      "to standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\n",
      "this work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\n",
      "propagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\n",

      "(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By\n",
      "assuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain\n",
      "(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino\n",

      "      AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to study\n",
      "surface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. The\n",
      "method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\n",
      "formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\n",
      "a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\n",
      "and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\n",
      "of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\n",
      "dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\n",
      "is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\n",
      "surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\n",
      "or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\n",
      "and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\n",
      "conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\n",
      "significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\n",
      "the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\n",
      "turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\n",
      "chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\n",
      "desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\n",
      "molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\n",
      "determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\n",
      "mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\n",
      "carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than\n",
      "a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement\n",
      "with observations.\n",

      "effective temperature of the stars and to compare the results with those\n",
      "obtained with a classical LTE abundance analysis. (i) For the field stars we\n",
      "find that the temperatures derived by means of the LDR method are in excellent\n",
      "agreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. This result is extremely\n",
      "encouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derive\n",

      "the IC 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive the\n",
      "following results. a) The reddening E(B-V) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,\n",
      "largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) The age of\n",
      "the cluster is 1.2+/-0.2 Gyr. c) The typical mass of the analysed giant stars\n",
      "is 2.0+/-0.2M_sun. Moreover, we find a systematic difference of about 0.2 dex\n",
      "in log g between spectroscopic and evolutionary values. We conclude that, in\n",

      "may indeed result in very reliable stellar parameters. We caution that the\n",
