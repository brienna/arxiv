      "EX Hya is an Intermediate Polar (IP), a sub-class of magnetic Cataclysmic Variable Stars (mCVs) where a late-type main sequence star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as the two stars orbit each other under the influence of their mutual gravitation.

This emission shows maximum blueshift at phase , suggesting that these are rotational velocities (or a combination of streaming and rotational velocities) of the antiphased motion of a source locked to the white dwarf. One possible explanation is that this emission comes from the opposite pole of the white dwarf, at a radial distance of 6 cm (8R). Siegel  (1989) found that the eclipsed optical source in EX Hya is centred at a radial distance of 1.5 cm (2R), which is about four times closer to the white dwarf compared to our result.

The resulting velocity could just be a measure of the degree to which the poles cancel their velocities near  km s(Coel Hellier; private communication). This, however, cannot be the case for H and H since these two emission lines show motion that is consistent with that of a rotating object, suggesting that the line profiles are not dominated by the infall velocities at the two opposite accretion poles. If they were produced close to the white dwarf then maximum rotational velocity near  km s would be 2 30 km s, which is much smaller than  km s. However, rotional velocities close to the ring are  km s.\n",
      "For H, however, we observe maximum blueshift at , and so velocity due to cancellation anywhere between 0 and  km sare expected, depending on how much the two poles cancel. If both accretion curtains are still visible and symmetric at large radii (which is possible as suggested by Ferrario, Wickramasinghe & King (1993) and our model), velocity cancellation will still result in smaller amplitudes than those of  km sobserved in our data. This would then count against the argument above.\n",
      "Furthermore, H orbital Doppler tomograms show strong emission at the bright spot. If our model is correct, the field lines should also attract this H dominated material, which is chanelled along the field lines, as already shown above. The velocity of this material due to streaming motion near the outer ring is less than that of the H broad-base component close to the white dwarf, as expected.\n",
      "A strong constraint on our model is that the disruption radius of EX Hya has been shown to be at 5-9 cm (\n",

The theoretical analysis of King & Wynn  (1999) and Wynn  (2000), however, has shown that equilibrium rotation is possible if the magnetic moment in EX Hya falls within the range of 10 G cm. These are comparable to weakest field AM Hers below the period gap, and that EX Hya could possess such magnetic moments is supported to a certain extent by the average-subtracted trailed spectra of EX Hya that are reminiscent of emission lines seen in some Polars, e.g. V834 Cen (as discussed above), EF Eri (\n",

      "The data obtained from LISA 1 will contain a large number of white dwarf binary systems across the whole observational window 2. At frequencies below  mHz the sources are so abundant that they produce a stochastic foreground whose intensity dominates the instrumental noise 3. The closer (and louder) sources will still be sufficiently bright to be individually resolvable. Above  mHz the sources become sufficiently sparse in parameter space (and in particular in the frequency domain) that the detectable sources become individually resolvable. The identification of white dwarfs in the LISA data set represents one of the most interesting analysis problems posed by the mission: the total number of signals in the data set is unknown, the effective noise level affecting the measurements is not easily estimated from the data streams, and there is a large number of overlapping sources to the limit of confusion.\n",

      "Bayesian inference provides a clear framework to tackle such a problem []. Some of us have carried out exploratory studies and “proof of concept” analyses on simplified problems that have demonstrated that Bayesian techniques do indeed show good potential for LISA applications []. Similarly other authors have successfully implemented techniques using Bayesian inference []. In this paper we present the first results of an end-to-end analysis pipeline developed in the context of the Mock LISA Data Challenges that has evolved from our earlier work. This pipeline is applied to the simplest single-source challenge data sets 1.1.1a and 1.1.1b and all the results presented here are obtained after the release of the key files. In a companion paper 19, we present results that we have obtained for the analysis of the data sets containing gravitational radiation from a massive-black-hole binary inspiral. Our group submitted an entry for the MLDC analysing the blind data set 1.1.1c []: however that result suffered from the fact that the pipeline was not complete, the analysis code was inefficient and we encountered hardware problems with the Beowulf cluster used to perform the analysis.\n",

Our method differs from other MCMC methods that have been proposed and applied to the MLDC data in the context of white dwarf binaries []: the MCMC is not used to search, but only in the final stage of the analysis to produce posterior density functions of the model parameters.

      "As the LISA array moves in space, the frequency  is affected by Doppler modulations. This modulation changes with differing position of the source in the sky, implying the need to recalculate the modulations and thus  and  for each sky position that is tested - a significant factor in the performance of this approach. The differing modulation structure however also allows us to estimate the location of the source in the sky by maximising the  value. The resolution possible on the sky with this method is not as good as from a full Bayesian posterior probability calculation as performed in the parameter estimation stage, as shown in an example for Challenge 1.1.1a in figure . Nevertheless, since this statistic can be computed fairly quickly it serves as a useful way of finding initial values to feed into the MCMC routine, as adopted within the pipeline. The resolution achievable on the sky increases with frequency, which implies that the mismatch between filter and signal falls off more rapidly at higher frequencies, requiring a greater number of templates to cover the sky. Therefore for challenge 1.1.1b at  a sky grid of size 5,752 points was used, in comparison with 765 points for challenge 1.1.1a at .\n",

The automated function of the Metropolis sampling is achieved by controlling the sampling step-size with adaptive acceptance probability techniques 26.

      "We found that the most promising candidate signal from the -statistic search already matched the true embedded signal to high accuracy, particularly in frequency and sky location. Our MCMC sampler, as a post-processing unit, thus only needed 1000 iterations to burn in and to establish a reliable sampling from the posterior. The marginalised posteriors are shown in Figs.  and  . We found, as seen in latter figures, that the MCMC sampler further refined the initial guesses from the -statistic, as measured by the absolute difference between the true value of a given parameter and the median of the marginalised posterior recovered for that parameter. Table  shows details of the statistics of recovered posterior distributions. We highlight that the majority of the true values of the parameters are within one standard deviation of the median of the posterior, with a small percentage within two sampled standard deviations. In addition, every true value of a parameter of the signal is within the minimum interval of the posterior to cover 90 of all MCMC state values. Recovered signal-to-noise ratios are measured as , and the match  between a template constructed from the true values and a template from the median values of the individual posterior distributions, yielding a correlation that is always higher than 0.97. Noise levels are determined accurately and within 1 to 1.5 sampled standard deviations. Nevertheless we note that our run on Challenge 1.1.1a shows a lower match and higher differences between true value and recovered value of parameters as compared to the run on Challenge 1.1.1b. It also exhibits tailing posterior distributions in inclination and amplitude, although the SNR of Challenge 1.1.1a is twice the value of Challenge 1.1.1b.\n",

      "We have presented a new approach to LISA data analysis in the form of an end-to-end pipeline. We first detected and identified candidate signals in the LISA data stream with a grid-based coherent algorithm, and then post-processed the most promising candidate signals with an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to obtain probability densities for the model’s parameters. We demonstrated successful identification and post-processing of the signals from the double white dwarf single source MLDC data sets 1.1.1a and 1.1.1b. Furthermore, the automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo code successfully identified the noise level within a small frequency window of interest in these data sets. We note that a parallel approach to the data analysis of binary inspiral signals is being developed by Röver et al, with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that can successfully post-process a candidate signal generated from the true parameters of the signal. Signal detection in a pre-processing stage is currently being tested within parallel tempered MCMC methods and/or time-frequency analyses 19.\n",

      "We identify two prominent and promising features of our pipeline: its ability to determine good initial conditions for the MCMC and its ability to run the MCMC automatically. As we have demonstrated in this paper, the width of the marginalised posterior density for the frequency parameter is extremely narrow. It is therefore vital that the initial estimate of the frequency is within this region, as the almost flat structure of the posterior PDF outside this region gives little to no information on the location of the peak. The chances of finding the mode through a random sampling are decreased further still with a larger prior range for the parameter. Adding an -statistic search as the first stage in the pipeline solves this problem, since the frequency and position in the sky are recovered very accurately, to within the limits of the posterior probability region of interest, before the MCMC performs post-processing and parameter estimation. The automatic feature of the MCMC ensures a successful post-processing for the other astrophysical parameters that may have been located outside the posterior region of interest by the -statistic approach, as in the case for the amplitude of Challenge 1.1.1a. Convergence is aided by the ability of our code to increase or decrease sampling step-sizes according to its experience of the sampling quality of the posterior during the burn-in phase.\n",

Current work includes the exploration of our grid-based coherent search on such data streams in order to automatically identify the most promising individual candidate signals, and the implementation of an automatic Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine (e.g. as already demonstrated in 10) to find the trans-dimensional probability density functions of the parameters of an unknown total number of signals. We highlight that the noise level determination presented here already serves as a key ingredient to round 2, where the simulation of a galactic white dwarf binary population introduces additional confusion noise levels from unresolvable sources.\n",

The OGLE systems are all much fainter than HAT-TR-205-013, which presents significant challenges for both the spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations. Spectroscopy with the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio suitable for determining accurate values for rotational broadening requires time on large telescopes, and photometry for high-quality light curves also requires large telescopes to achieve the needed photon statistics. Eclipsing binaries identified by wide-angle surveys are much brighter and therefore less challenging on both counts.\n",

      "Our value for the radius of the M-dwarf secondary in HAT-TR-205-013 lies 11 percent, about 3-, above the theoretical isochrones. This divergence is further reinforced by Eq.(11), which, as has been previously noted, restricts the position of HAT-TR-205-013 B to lie on a single line that is determined by the surface gravity of the object. This gravity curve does not rely on any prior assumptions about the HAT-TR-205-013 system, nor does it depend upon our measured value of , which is the biggest contributor of uncertainty to our final results. We use the assumption of synchronization and the spectroscopically measured  to place HAT-TR-205-013 B at a specific location along the curve, but it is important to note that in the region that we find HAT-TR-205-013 B, the curve of allowable locations runs nearly parallel to the theoretical models. This is illustrated in Figure  by the red line that passes through our point for HAT-TR-205-013 B. Thus the conclusion that the theoretical models predict a radius for HAT-TR-205-013 B that is too small by about 10 percent is on much firmer ground than the error bar in the observed radius might suggest. Indeed, it would require a 6- difference in  to place HAT-TR-205-013 B onto the Baraffe models.\n",

      "Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B supports the suggestion from the results for double-lined eclipsing binaries plotted in Figure  that the models predict radii for M dwarfs that are too small by up to 10 percent. This discrepancy has been noted before, for example by Torres & Ribas (2002) in the case of YY Gem. Torres et al. (2006) raised the issue of whether short-period eclipsing binaries are representative of isolated field stars and wide binaries where tidal forces are negligible. They suggested that the rapid rotation of the stars in these systems caused by tidal synchronization might give rise to enhanced magnetic activity, thus decreasing the efficiency of energy transport in the convective envelopes and leading to inflated stellar radii. For low mass stars, this effect is examined in more detail by Lopez-Morales (2007).\n",

      "In the case of HAT-TR-205-013, we see no evidence in the photometry of star spots on the primary star, which would be tell-tale indicators of enhanced stellar magnetic activity. Though HAT-TR-205-013 A is rapidly rotating, the lack of magnetic ativity is not suprising, given its spectral type (F7). The star’s outer convective layer is relatively shallow, and it is not unusual for rapidly rotating stars of this type to lack strong magnetic activity (\n",

This would serve as a check to the assumption of tidal synchronization in the system.\n",
