    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we convert preprints from TEX to XML, a format that simplifies downstream parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each submission in the ./latex/ folder should contain 1 or more .tex files. If the submission contains more than 1 .tex file, we identify the main file. The additional files are usually inserts for the main file. \n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting the filepaths for all submissions' main files, we convert them from .tex to .xml using the [latexml](https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/) package, spreading the work across all CPU cores (4 on my machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "All converted .xml files are stored in ./xml/.\n",
